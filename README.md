## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, React.js


## Lessons Learned:

1. Creating React Components to house similar code
2. Fetching API from Nasa in React
3. The use of passing React props to components 
4. Conditional rendering 

The integration of NASA's API was succesful in this project and it reinforced the concept of using API's, familiarizing myself with the syntax that is involved with it, and implementing React.js.
